Adthena Python Analyst Coding Exercise

Write a program driven by unit tests that can price a basket of products taking into account some special
offers. The program should demonstrate your knowledge of clean extendible code.

Products: Soup, Bread, Milk, Apples

Current Discounts:   
● Apples have a 10% discount off their normal price this week.  
● Buy 2 tins of soup and get a loaf of bread for half price

In Original Task, it is not mentioned quantity of each product but I think if we do not add quantity of product 2nd discount policy will not be abled to applied.
Because of that Reason I give good explanation inside of program, so user will easily understand what to do.

To run script please clone repo to local and run 'python PriceBasket.py' in cmd (do not forget to change location of CMD)
